Russian Gold Price vs Global Gold Spot Price

This repo was created to show how the price of gold in Russia is significantly cheaper than the price of gold on the global spot market.

The reason for this is that the Russian central bank uses gold as a means to prop up the value of the Russian Ruble. 

Since the price of gold is lower in Russia than on the global spot market, this creates an opportunity for arbitrage. 

However, to exectue this arbitrage, a trader must first buy Russian gold with Russian Rubles, thus creating demand for Russian Rubles.

This purpose of this repository is not political, merely an educational jypter notebook showing one of the means a Central Bank can affect the exchange rate of it's country's currency.
